# UnAd

### A Scalable SMS Marketing Platform for Local Businesses

---

## About the Project

UnAd is a robust, scalable SMS marketing platform designed to help small and medium-sized businesses engage with their customers through targeted text messaging.  It was originally released as a SaaS product in October of 2023.

Built as a monorepo, the project demonstrates a modern, modular architecture with clean separation of concerns and the ability to scale across components seamlessly.

While this system was designed to solve real-world challenges, the public version of this repository is shared for educational purposes only.

## Why This Project is Public

As a software architect with decades of experience building scalable systems, I wanted to provide a real-world example of:

- **Modern Monorepo Architecture:** Featuring React (marketing and signup), GraphQL, and .NET 8 services.
- **Message-Driven Design:** Using Kafka to handle asynchronous, out-of-process tasks.
- **Full-Stack Integration:** Orchestrating frontend, backend, and infrastructure to demonstrate end-to-end workflows.
- **Clean, Maintainable Code:** Following best practices for scalability, readability, and reliability.

This repository serves as a showcase of how complex systems can be designed and implemented for clarity, extensibility, and long-term maintainability.
