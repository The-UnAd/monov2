# UnAd System POC Repository

Welcome to the UnAd system POC repository.  This repo is meant to demonstrate of the of the necessary components of the upcoming UnAd system and be used as a starting point for development.

## Repository Structure

The UnAd system architecture is guided by Domain-Driven principals in terms of structure.  This repository structure attempts to reflect that approach as much as possible.  The primary directories of interest are as follows.

- `app` -- This directory contains code for the React Native application and related libraries.
- `auth` -- This directory contains code for the authorization/authentication related services and libraries.
- `lib` -- This directory contains code shared by various parts of the system.
- `dotnet` -- This directory contains code related to the .NET-based aspects of the system.
- `mkdocs` -- This directory contains more extensive documentation on the system and how it is designed.
- `scripts` -- This directory contains utility and convenience scripts for general purpose use in this repository.

## Initial Setup

Following an initial clone of this repository, some setup is required for everything to go smoothly.

First, some basic configuration is required.  Create a file named `.env.default` at the root of the repository.  It should contain the following entries:

```env
AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER = "626564493841"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "<key_here>"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "<secret_key_here>"
AWS_REGION = "us-east-2"
AWS_ECR_ACCOUNT_URL = "626564493841.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com"
```

These values can be found in the AWS Console.

> `AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER` can be found at the top of any Console window.  It is the number after the "@" symbol ![AWS Account Number](img/aws-account-number.png){: .zoom }

> `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are generated by creating [Access Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html).
