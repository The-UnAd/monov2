# Contributing to Documentation

In order to use this project, you must first install Python, MkDocs (`pip3 install mkdocs`), and the requirements from the `requirements.txt` file in this directory (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`).

Once done, you can view the built site with `mkdocs serve`.

> **NOTE:** If `mkdocs` doesn't seem to be in your `PATH` after installation, check that the `bin` directory for your local Python installation is included in your `PATH`.
